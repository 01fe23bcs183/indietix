### Project Progress

Track our development progress in real-time: [**PROGRESS.md**](./PROGRESS.md)

The progress report is automatically updated when code is merged to main and includes:
- Overall project completion percentage
- Progress by milestone (Foundation, Core Packages, Applications, Governance)
- Detailed task status and assignments

### Code Quality

- **Secret Scanning**: Gitleaks runs on every push to prevent credential leaks
- **Linting**: ESLint with zero warnings policy
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode enabled
- **Automated Reviews**: CodeRabbit AI reviews all pull requests
- **Dependency Updates**: Dependabot checks weekly for security updates
