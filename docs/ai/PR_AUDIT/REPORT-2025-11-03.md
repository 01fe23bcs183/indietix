## Executive Summary

This audit reviewed 21 merged pull requests from the last 14 days in the indietix repository. The analysis identified **14 total findings** across 13 PRs.

**Findings Breakdown:**
- **Critical:** 13 (CI failures, security issues)
- **Major:** 0 (missing tests, unresolved threads)
- **Minor:** 1 (documentation, TODOs)

**Key Themes:**
1. **CI Failures:** 13 PRs merged with failing CI checks (primarily affecting feature PRs #48-59 and dependency updates)
2. **Test Coverage:** Most feature PRs included tests, but CI failures prevented verification
3. **Code Quality:** No major issues with unresolved review threads or missing tests in logic changes
4. **Dependency Updates:** Several Dependabot PRs merged with CI failures

**Risk Level:** 🔴 **HIGH** — Multiple PRs merged with failing CI checks indicate a systemic issue with the CI pipeline or merge process.

## Risk Register

### Top 5 Risks

1. **CI Pipeline Reliability (Critical)**
   - **Issue:** 13 PRs merged with failing CI checks
   - **Impact:** Untested code in production, potential bugs, broken builds
   - **Recommendation:** Investigate CI failures, enforce required checks, consider branch protection rules
   - **Owner:** DevOps/Platform team

2. **Dependency Update CI Failures (Critical)**
   - **Issue:** Dependabot PRs (#23, #31, #34, #42) merged with failing CI
   - **Impact:** Dependency updates not properly validated
   - **Recommendation:** Review Dependabot workflow, ensure CI passes before merge
   - **Owner:** DevOps team

3. **Feature PR CI Failures (Critical)**
   - **Issue:** Major feature PRs (#48-59) merged with CI failures
   - **Impact:** Core features (booking, payments, notifications) not fully validated
   - **Recommendation:** Audit these features manually, add integration tests
   - **Owner:** Engineering leads

4. **Large PR Without Tests (Minor)**
   - **Issue:** PR #2 (20 files) merged without test coverage
   - **Impact:** Infrastructure changes not validated
   - **Recommendation:** Add tests for critical infrastructure code
   - **Owner:** PR author

5. **CI Configuration Issues (Critical)**
   - **Issue:** Many PRs show "no-ci" status, suggesting CI not running on all PRs
   - **Impact:** Inconsistent validation across PRs
   - **Recommendation:** Review GitHub Actions configuration, ensure CI runs on all PRs
   - **Owner:** DevOps team

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Investigate CI failures** for PRs #48-59 and determine root cause
2. **Run manual tests** for critical features (booking, payments, tickets, refunds)
3. **Review branch protection rules** to prevent merging with failing CI
4. **Audit Dependabot configuration** to ensure proper CI validation

### Short-term Actions (Next Sprint)
1. **Fix CI pipeline** to ensure reliable test execution
2. **Add required status checks** in GitHub branch protection
3. **Document merge criteria** for the team
4. **Set up CI monitoring** to alert on failures

### Long-term Actions (Next Quarter)
1. **Implement pre-merge validation** (e.g., merge queue)
2. **Add integration tests** for critical paths
3. **Set up test coverage tracking** and enforce minimums
4. **Regular audit process** (monthly PR reviews)
